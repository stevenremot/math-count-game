# Math count game

A basic web page that serves as a support for playing a math game with
school children learning basic arithmetic operations.

A live version is available at https://math-count.noizman.com

The web page just computes a target number (the red one) and other
numbers (the white ones) that should be combines to try to get as
close as possible to the target.
